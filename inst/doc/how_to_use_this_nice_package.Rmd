The function with two arguments formula and data that returns an object with of
class linreg as a RC class.


## Note to the user

This package was prepared using linear algebra application to linear regression. The choice of QR decomposition was for faster computation power. The formulae may be beyond the scope of the user.

This particular package is purely for academic purposes and it has no wide application except to the particular inbuilt preloaded dataset in R base, iris.


This package demonstrates application of Object Oriented Programming in R using RC or otherwsie called S5.
